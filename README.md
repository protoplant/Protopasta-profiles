![Protopasta Filament Profiles for Slicers](./images/protopasta-logo.png "Protopasta Filament Profiles for Slicers")

This repository contains a number of common slicer profiles for various Protopasta filament types.

Slicers that are currently supported (so far):

- Cura and derivatives: Creality Slicer, Blackbelt Cura, Dremel Slicer, ...
- PrusaSlicer, SuperSlicer
- ideaMaker
- Simplify3D

# How to Use

Each profile requires a number of steps to install that also depend on your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux).

Please reference each slicer below.

## Cura, Creality Slicer, Blackbelt Slicer, Dremel Slicer, etc

The Ultimaker Cura-family of slicers all have a 3rd part library managed called The Marketplace. Protopasta has published all materials to this marketplace, making it easy to select and install.

## PrusaSlicer and SuperSlicer

Browse to the Releases section and download the latest version. Optionally, see the Release documentation for what has recently changed.

TODO: insert video for downloading files, unzipping, and placing in proper directory

# Auto-Updates

Some slicers support auto-updates of filament profiles as updates are published regularly. Where applicable, these have been included with these profiles as well.

If your slicer does not support auto-updates, or you prefer to update them manually, just follow the standard installation procedures to overwrite as upgrades are simply overwriting.
